## Description

This Python project provides a simple implementation of encryption and decryption using the `cryptography.fernet` library. It allows you to encrypt the contents of a specified file and store the encrypted data, along with a generated encryption key, into a new file. The encrypted data can later be decrypted using the same key.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- `cryptography` library version 3.4 or higher

## Installation

To use this project, you'll need to install the `cryptography` library. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install cryptography
